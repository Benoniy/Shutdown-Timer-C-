# Shutdown Timer C:  

This is a small project that I made for my own convenience, it's simply a timer that is capable  
of running windows commands upon completion. It gives the user the option to shutdown, reboot  
or log off after a user specified delay. This is an updated version of the program I made in java.

### Prerequisites:  

* Windows 7 or higher

### How to run the program:  

Simply run the .exe file located in the git repository.
